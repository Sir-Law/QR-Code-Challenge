## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- [Font component](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap)

### What I learned

```html
<main>
  <section class="qr-container">
      <img src="images\image-qr-code.png" alt="qr image">
  </section>
</main>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  visibility: hidden;
  border-radius: 10px;
  object-fit: cover;
  max-width: 100%;
  padding: 0.9rem;
  padding-bottom: 100px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  text-align: center;
}


### Continued development

I need more research and enlightenment on the css navigation properties such as display, position, padding, etc. 

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - This helped me understand font color. It as an exciting journey learning from it.
- [Resource 2](https://fonts.google.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand font family and icons. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
